# Handlebars example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aurojr/handlebars-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aurojr/handlebars-example)

This project is a personal history of mine on projecting a JS project, regarding organizing the code, choosing frameworks and analysing the pros and cons of each one. Moreover, the difficulties when transitioning from one to another.
As the initial approach was by using handlebars as a template framework, the project name is *handlebars-example*, but it can change in the future.

## Current history
- [x] Build a project using Java Script together with JQuery and Handlebars
- [x] Rework to organize the code in pseudo-modules: organizing what can functions can be used
- [x] Reorganize callbacks using Promises
- [ ] Fix packages versions
- [ ] Rework to use backbone.js
- [ ] Pre-compile handlebar templates and check pros and cons
- [ ] Future?
